Unity3D-Futile-StartPoint
=========================

This is what I start with on a new project, think of it as a booster rocket for game development with Unity3D and Futile.

**Assumptions:**
* Using [Unity3D 4.0](http://unity3d.com/unity/)
* Using [Futile](https://github.com/MattRix/Futile)

_Note: I did not commit any of the files or folders that would come from installing the packages, like Futile._
